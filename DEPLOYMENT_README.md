# Transportation Dashboard Deployment Options

This document provides an overview of the deployment options for the Transportation Dashboard application. Detailed instructions for each deployment option are available in the respective deployment guides.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Recommended for**: Organizations already using Google Cloud services, those requiring Document AI integration for PDF processing, or those needing a fully managed cloud solution.

**Key Benefits**:
- Seamless integration with Google Document AI for PDF processing
- Managed PostgreSQL database with Cloud SQL
- Scalable container hosting with Cloud Run
- Built-in CI/CD with Cloud Build
- Centralized monitoring and logging

**Estimated Cost**: $50-200/month depending on traffic and resource usage

**Deployment Guide**: [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_GCP.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_GCP.md)

### 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**Recommended for**: Organizations already using AWS, those requiring high availability across multiple regions, or those with existing AWS infrastructure.

**Key Benefits**:
- Comprehensive ecosystem
- Potentially lower costs for certain workloads
- Robust security features
- Global infrastructure with multiple regions

**Estimated Cost**: $40-180/month depending on traffic and resource usage

**Deployment Guide**: [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_AWS.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_AWS.md)

### 3. Self-Hosted / On-Premises

**Recommended for**: Organizations with existing server infrastructure, those requiring complete control over their data, or those with specific compliance requirements.

**Key Benefits**:
- Complete control over infrastructure
- No vendor lock-in
- Potentially lower costs for stable workloads
- Ability to customize hardware for specific needs

**Estimated Cost**: $20-100/month for VPS hosting, or existing infrastructure costs

## Deployment Architecture

Regardless of the deployment option, the Transportation Dashboard application follows a similar architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Containerization

All deployment options use Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments. The application is divided into three main containers:

1. **Frontend Container**: Nginx serving the React application
2. **Backend Container**: FastAPI application with business logic
3. **Database Container**: PostgreSQL database

## Choosing the Right Deployment Option

Consider the following factors when choosing a deployment option:

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: If you already have infrastructure in a specific cloud provider or on-premises, it may be more cost-effective to use that.

2. **Technical Expertise**: Cloud platforms provide managed services that reduce operational overhead, while self-hosting requires more expertise.

3. **Budget**: Self-hosting can be more cost-effective for stable workloads, while cloud platforms offer pay-as-you-go pricing.

4. **Scaling Requirements**: Cloud platforms offer easier scaling for variable workloads.

5. **Integration Requirements**: If you need integration with specific services (e.g., Google Document AI), choose the platform that offers those services.

6. **Compliance Requirements**: Some organizations may have specific compliance requirements that dictate where data can be stored.

## Getting Started

1. Review the deployment options and choose the one that best fits your needs.
2. Follow the detailed instructions in the respective deployment guide.
3. Set up monitoring and alerting to ensure the application runs smoothly.
4. Implement a backup strategy to protect your data.
5. Set up CI/CD for automated deployments.
